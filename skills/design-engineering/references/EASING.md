## The Easing Blueprint

### ease-out (Most Common)

Use for **user-initiated interactions**: dropdowns, modals, tooltips, any element entering or exiting the screen.

```css
/* Sorted weak to strong */
--ease-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
--ease-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
--ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
--ease-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
```

Why it works: Acceleration at the start creates an instant, responsive feeling. The element "jumps" toward its destination then settles in.

### ease-in-out (For Movement)

Use when **elements already on screen need to move or morph**. Mimics natural motion like a car accelerating then braking.

```css
/* Sorted weak to strong */
--ease-in-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.455, 0.03, 0.515, 0.955);
--ease-in-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1);
--ease-in-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
--ease-in-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.86, 0, 0.07, 1);
--ease-in-out-expo: cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1);
--ease-in-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.15, 0.86);
```

### ease (For Hover Effects)

Use for **hover states and color transitions**. The asymmetrical curve (faster start, slower end) feels elegant for gentle animations.

```css
transition: background-color 150ms ease;
```

### linear (Avoid in UI)

Only use for:

- Constant-speed animations (marquees, tickers)
- Time visualization (hold-to-delete progress indicators)

Linear feels robotic and unnatural for interactive elements.

### ease-in (Almost Never)

**Avoid for UI animations.** Makes interfaces feel sluggish because the slow start delays visual feedback.

### Paired Elements Rule

Elements that animate together must use the same easing and duration. Modal + overlay, tooltip + arrow, drawer + backdrop—if they move as a unit, they should feel like a unit.

```css
/* Both use the same timing */
.modal {
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.overlay {
  transition: opacity 200ms ease-out;
}
```

## Timing and Duration

## Duration Guidelines

| Element Type                      | Duration  |
| --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Micro-interactions                | 100-150ms |
| Standard UI (tooltips, dropdowns) | 150-250ms |
| Modals, drawers                   | 200-300ms |

**Rules:**

- UI animations should stay under 300ms
- Larger elements animate slower than smaller ones
- Exit animations can be ~20% faster than entrance
- Match duration to distance - longer travel = longer duration

### The Frequency

Determine how often users will see the animation:

- **100+ times/day** → No animation (or drastically reduced)
- **Occasional use** → Standard animation
- **Rare/first-time** → Can be more special

**Example:** Raycast never animates because users open it hundreds of times a day.

## Easing Decision Flowchart

Is the element entering or exiting the viewport?
├── Yes → ease-out
└── No
├── Is it moving/morphing on screen?
│ └── Yes → ease-in-out
└── Is it a hover change?
├── Yes → ease
└── Is it constant motion?
├── Yes → linear
└── Default → ease-out
